#### **Matter** is anything which occupies space and have mass, for example a ball etc. And matter consists of very small particles which is termed as atoms. These atomic particles can be further classified into Electron, Proton and Neutron. We all know that every single particle emits energy, one such source is light energy from a bulb. 

#### The **human body** is made of multiple cells which make up tissues, multiple tissues make up organs and the organs finally makes an organism. The nature is classified into two different sections the plant world and the animal world.

#### The **human skeleton** is the internal framework of the **human** body. It is composed of around 270 **bones** at birth – this total decreases to around 206 **bones** by adulthood after some bones get fused together. The cranium—the part of the skull that encloses the brain—is sometimes called the braincase. The assumption of erect posture during the development of the human species has led to a need for adaptation and changes in the human skeletal system. The very form of the human vertebral column is due to such adaptations and changes.

#### **Human nervous system**, system that conducts stimuli from sensory receptors to the brain and spinal cord and conducts impulses back to other parts of the body. As with other higher vertebrates, the human nervous system has two main parts: the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (the nerves that carry impulses to and from the central nervous system).

#### The human eye is an organ that reacts to light in many circumstances. As a conscious sense organ the human eye allows vision.

#### Deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA) is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses.
